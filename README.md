# GridWise
This tool supports universal energy access by streamlining LV grid planning in urban settings. It combines spatial analysis with electrical design, selecting circuit breakers, sizing conductors for voltage drop, loading, and short-circuitsâ€”delivering spatially aligned and electrically sound solutions.
